Portly is a dead simple TCP port scanner that will reveal open, filtered, and closed ports on a target host. All results can be easily exported to CSV or JSON files for use elsewhere.

Portly provides a demo target for free to give you a feel for how it works and verify its results if you so choose. Purchase the full version to unlock the ability to add your own targets.
